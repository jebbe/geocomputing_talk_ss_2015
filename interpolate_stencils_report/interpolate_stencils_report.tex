\title{Interpolation of FEM stencils in HHG for projected coordinates}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this report, we investigate the influence of projected coordinates on
the shape of the FEM stencils in HHG. To this end, we print and visualize 
the stencils of all inner points within on macro tetrahedron for constant
and projected coordinates. Since the displacements of the projected stencils
exhibt a smooth shape, we further employ a quadratic interpolation of
these stencils instead of the costly computation via local stiffness matrices.
Further investigations are made in order to show if this approach is feasible.
Finally we extend this approach also to variable coefficients.

\begin{section}{Stencils for constant and projected coordinates}

We start our investigation with the scalar poisson operator on a spherical
shell with constant coefficients. 
The input grid for HHG consists of $N$ macro tetrahedra. Each of these
macro elements is refined $l$ times, i.e. there are $n_T$ inner fine grid nodes
within one tetrahedron.
\begin{equation}
n_T = \left(2^l - 3\right)\cdot\left(2^l - 2\right)\cdot\left(2^l - 1\right)/6
\end{equation}
Here we choose $l=5$, i.e. we get 4495 inner nodes.

Since we are using tetrahedral elements with linear FE spaces, the stencil
for each inner node consists of 15 entries,  denoted by
\emph{ME, MNW, MN, TS, TSE, TW, TC, BC, BE, BNW, BN, MS, MSE, MW, MC}.
We will refer to corresponding stencil values of this ensemble as 
$\si$, where $i$ selects the desired
entry, i.e, $1 \leq i \leq 15$.

We modify the HHG implementation to print the coordinates and all stencil entries
for all nodes of exatly one macro tetrahedron. W.l.o.g. we choose the tetrahedral
element with ID=0.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:tet0Nodes} all interior nodes for constant and projected coordinates
are shown.

\begin{figure}\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pics/tetInnerNodes} 
\caption{All interior nodes of one macro tetrahedron at refinement level 5.
Blue points are for constant and the red for projected coordinates.}
\label{fig:tet0Nodes}
\end{figure}   

Since we are only interest in stencils within macro tetrahedra, and not in macro faces,
edges and vertices, we will now change our point of view and refer to these interior points
as \emph{tetrahedron}, where the four outermost nodes form its \emph{corners}. 
And all nodes lying on a straight between two corner nodes are denoted as \emph{edge}.


Now we will have a closer look on the stencils for this tetrahedron. As it is difficult 
to visualize 15-dimensional values in the 3-dimensional space, the tetrahedron is
cut into slices $S_k$, $k = 1,...,n_E$, corresponding to planes formed by the nodes
with constant coordinates.
$n_E$ is the number of nodes along one edge, with
\begin{equation}
n_E = 2^l-3.
\end{equation}
And in slice $S_k$, there are
\begin{equation}
n_{S_k} = k(k+1)/2
\end{equation}
points.

We reduce the 3-dimensional space to 2D by the simple projection $(x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y)$.
Note, that for each slice $S_k$ this is an bijective mapping, as 
$z = z(x,y)\enspace\forall(x,y,z)\in S_k$ and as long as $S_k$ is not orhtogonal to the
z-axis. Now, the stencils can be visualized by using
the mapped spatial coordinates and plotting $\si$ in z-direction. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:stencilCCvsVC} some $\si$ are illustrated for $S_{n_E}$. This is a
random selection as all of the $\si$ exhibit a similiar shape. This also holds for other
$S_k$.
Naturally, as we consider here only constant coefficients, the particular stencil values 
for constant coordinates are equal for all nodes of the tetrahedron. Whereas for projected
coordinates we can observe some displacement. However, these displacements seem to
be a smooth function with some curvature in it. This motivates the assumption, that each
$\si$ can be fitted by a polynomial model. Due to the curvature, a linear fit is likely 
to be inaccurate, but quadratic polynomial may due it. So in the following we will 
investigate this approach.
Going to higher degrees may give additional accuracy, but will also increase the 
implentation complexity and computational costs. Therefore we will stick to the 
quadratic approach.

\begin{section}{Interpolation of stencils}
For quadratic interpolation within on tetrahedron we choose the ansatz function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadraticPolynomial}
a_{200}x^2 + a_{020}y^2 + a_{002}z^2 + a_{110}xy + a_{101}xz + a_{011}yz + 
a_{100}x + a_{010}y + a_{001}z + a_{000}
\end{equation}
Therefore we have to compute 10 coefficients $a_{(\cdot\cdot\cdot)}$, that is we
have to choose 10 sample points. Naturally, we choose the four corner nodes plus the six
edge midnodes, see Fig.~\ref{fig:samplePoints}

\begin{figure}\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{pics/tetSamplePoints} 
\caption{Ten sample points (red) for quadratic interpolation of stencil values for 
all interior nodes (blue) within on macro tetrahedron (black). For visualization,
the constant coordinates have been used, but for the interpolation the projected
will be utilised.}
\label{fig:samplePoints}
\end{figure}  


\begin{subsection}{HHG Implementation}
In HHG this approach is realised by defining two new kernels 
\emph{tet\_gs\_coordsInterpolate.cc}
and \emph{tet\_residual\_coordsInterpolate.cc} based on \emph{tet\_gs\_coords.cc} and 
\emph{tet\_gs\_coords.cc}. As the stencil setup for gs and residual is the same, 
the modifications are identic in both files.

First, all $\si$ are computed for the ten sample points like in the original kernel. 
Additionaly the (projected) x,y,z coordinates are used to build the $10\times10$ 
matrix $A$, with 
$A_{j,:} = \left[x_j^2\quad y_j^2\quad z_j^2\quad x_jy_j\quad x_jz_j\quad y_jz_j\quad
x_j\quad y_j\quad z_j\quad 1\right]$, $j = 1,...,10$.
Furthermore, the ten sample stencils are stored in a $10\times15$ matrix B,
with $B_{j,i} = \left(\si\right)_j$, $i = 1,...,15$, $j=1,...,10$. 
As this approach is intended to work 
also for tensor valued operators, e.g. full tensor, this scheme is repeated for each
operator entry, i.e, we have $A[op]$ and $B[op]$.

Note, that for each stencil entry we need one interpolation polynomial, i.e. we
have to compute $15\cdot10$ coefficients $a_{(\cdot\cdot\cdot)}^i$. To get these
coefficients one has to solve the linear system $Ax_i = B_{:,i}$,
where $x_i$ represents the coefficient vector for stencil entry $i$.

To this end, we include LAPACK for solving this linear system 15 times. 
Note, that $A$ doesn't change, so in fact we have to do one LU-decomposition
and perform 15 forward and backward substitutions.

Technically $A[op]$ and $B[op]$ are linear arrays for passing them to LAPACK. 

Once the coefficients have been computed, the interpolation of the stencils for
all tetrahedra nodes is straight forward. For each node, get its (projected) coordinates
and insert them into \eqref{eq:quadraticPolynomial}. One evaluation
of this polynomial consists of 21 multiplications and 9 additions, so in total 
\textbf{30 FLOPS}. This has to be done 15 times. 

For consistency, the center stencil
entry MC is set to the negative sum of all other entries.

\begin{section}{Interpolation of local stiffness matrices}

Let $F_S : \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^{15}$ be the representation of the 15pt stencil
for point $(x,y,z)$. Then the interpolation of the particular stencil entries reads
as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:interpolationStencil}
F_S(x,y,z) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
f^1(x,y,z) \\
\vdots \\
f^{15}(x,y,z)
\end{pmatrix}
\approx
\begin{pmatrix}
p^f_1(x,y,z) \\
\vdots \\
p^f_{15}(x,y,z)
\end{pmatrix}
=: P^f(x,y,z)
\end{equation}
Where $p^f_i$ are quadratic polynomials.
On the other hand, $f^i$ is a sum over local element stiffness matrix entries 
$e_j^i$ depending on $i$ ($i = 1,...,15$). 
Therefore, the interpolation of the local stiffness matrices reads as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:interpolationLocStiffness}
F_S(x,y,z) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\sum_{j=1}^{n_1}e_j^1(x,y,z) \\
\vdots \\
\sum_{j=1}^{n_{15}}e_j^{15}(x,y,z) 
\end{pmatrix}
\approx
\begin{pmatrix}
\sum_{j=1}^{n_1}p_{1,j}^e(x,y,z)  \\
\vdots \\
\sum_{j=1}^{n_{15}}p_{15,j}^e(x,y,z) 
\end{pmatrix}
=: P^e(x,y,z)
\end{equation}
with quadratic polynomials $p^e_{i,j}$.

\begin{theorem}
Both approaches are equivalent, i.e. $P^f = P^s$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Throughout this proof it holds $i = 1,...,15$.
As $p^f_i$ and $p^e_{i,j}$ are quadratic polynomials, there exists 
a functional $\P_i : \RR^{10} \rightarrow \Pi^2$ which maps a
10-dimensional sample tuple linearly (and uniquely) 
onto a quadratic polynomial.

Let $f^i(x_k,y_k,z_k) =:f_k^i$ be the sample points
for $p^f_i$ and $e^i_j(x_k,y_k,z_k) =:e_{j,k}^i$ for $p^e_{i,j}$
with $k = 1,...,10$.
Then, it is
\begin{equation*}
\P_i(f^i_1,...,f^i_{10}) = p_i^f \in \Pi^2
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\P_i(e^i_{j,1},...,e^i_{j,10}) = p_{i,j}^e \in \Pi^2.
\end{equation*}
Then it holds for each $i= 1,...,15$
\begin{align*}
\begin{split}
P^e_i(x,y,z) &= \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} p^e_{i,j} 
 = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\left[\P_i\left(e^i_{j,1},...,e^i_{j,10}\right)(x,y,z)\right] \\
 &\stackrel{(1)}{=} \left[\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\P_i\left(e^i_{j,1},...,e^i_{j,10}\right)\right](x,y,z) \\
 &\stackrel{(2)}{=} \P_i\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\left(e^i_{j,1},...,e^i_{j,10}\right)\right)(x,y,z) \\
 &\stackrel{(3)}{=} \P_i\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}e^i_{j,1},...,\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}e^i_{j,10}\right)(x,y,z) \\
 &= \P_i\left(f^i_1,...,f^i_{10}\right)(x,y,z) \\
 &= p_i^f(x,y,z) = P_i^f(x,y,z).
\end{split}
\end{align*}
(1) addtion of $\Pi^2$ elements\\
(2) $\P_i$ is linear \\
(3) basic vector addition\\
And therefore, $P^f = P^s$.
\end{proof}
